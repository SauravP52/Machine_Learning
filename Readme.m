This repository contains the algorithmic practices of Machine Learning
using simple algorithm such as KNN in both R and Python

--------
The Contents of this Repository are as follows:

1.KNN.R
-- Made from scratch using R .. This code demonstrates the KNN Algorith using 
the Iris dataset. Here i have selected 135 elements for training the algorithm
and the remaining datasets for testing purpose:

2.KNN.py
-- This uses the standard machine learning libraries such as numpy,scikitlearn
and mathplotlib to use the simplest machine learning algorithm KNN. We have 
also plotted the graph for the better understanding of the dataset using the 
mathplotlib function.
